Before running this script, there are a few things you should check and consider:

1.Security: You are storing your email password as an environment variable. Make sure to set this variable securely and do not expose sensitive information in your code.

2.Email Credentials: Ensure that the provided email address (sender) and password are correct, and you have the necessary permissions to send emails via the chosen SMTP server (in this case, "smtp.mail.rambler.ru").

3.Attachments: The script assumes that attachments are located in the "attachments" directory. Make sure this directory exists, and your attachments are placed there.

4.MIME Types: The script identifies the MIME types of attachments based on their file extensions. Ensure that your attachments have the correct extensions that correspond to their types (e.g., ".jpg" for images, ".mp3" for audio).

5.Template: If you're using an HTML template for your email, make sure the template file is correctly located and formatted.

6.Server Configuration: Verify that the SMTP server ("smtp.mail.com") and port (587) are correct for your email provider. Some email providers may require additional settings. To send email from any email service, you will need to adjust the SMTP server settings, including the hostname and port, as well as the security settings (e.g., TLS or SSL). 1. Update the SMTP server and port for Gmail server = smtplib.SMTP("smtp.gmail.com", 587) server.starttls() 2. Update the SMTP server and port for Outlook/Hotmail server = smtplib.SMTP("smtp.live.com", 587) server.starttls().

7.Dependencies: Ensure that you have the required Python libraries installed. You can use pip to install any missing libraries. In your case, you need to install 'pyfiglet' and 'tqdm' using the following commands: pip install pyfiglet and pip install tqdm.
